-- FIX SECURITY DEFINER VIEWS - Quick Remediation
-- =====================================================
-- This script removes SECURITY DEFINER from 6 views
-- that are currently flagged by Supabase linter
-- =====================================================

-- IMPORTANT: Views themselves cannot have SECURITY DEFINER
-- The linter is detecting that these views were somehow created
-- with SECURITY DEFINER, which is unusual. We'll recreate them
-- as standard views (SECURITY INVOKER by default)

-- =====================================================
-- 1. FIX debug_logs VIEW
-- =====================================================

    details
FROM app_logs 
WHERE level = 'DEBUG' 
ORDER BY timestamp DESC;

COMMENT ON VIEW debug_logs IS 'View of debug-level log entries';
GRANT SELECT ON debug_logs TO authenticated, service_role;

-- =====================================================
-- 2. FIX users_public VIEW
-- =====================================================
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS users_public CASCADE;

CREATE VIEW users_public 
WITH (security_invoker=true)
AS
